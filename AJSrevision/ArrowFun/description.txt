With an arrow function:

No more function keywords are need, and parenthesis are optional as well as curly braces.
Arrow functions make code shorter, more concise, and less verbose.
The keyword return would indeed be optional. The Arrow function has an implicit return. Thus no curly braces. 
If you are using the curly braces, you have to use the return statement.
Arrow functions are not attached to an identifier (the function name). To call or reuse them, your need to 
assign them to a variable.
They are frequently used in callback chaining, promise chaining, array methods, and situations where 
anonymous (the function has no name) functions would be useful.
They handle this operator a lot more clearly. The Arrow functions shine most whenever you need this to be 
attached to the context and not its own function.
