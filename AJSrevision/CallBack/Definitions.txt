A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside 
the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

The benefit of using a callback function is that you can wait for the result of a previous function call and
then execute another function call.

The callback function is helpful when you have to wait for a result that takes time. For example, the data 
coming from a server because it takes time for data to arrive.
